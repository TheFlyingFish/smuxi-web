# Contribute #

Since Smuxi is open-source and free software it is developed by [volunteers][].
Without these volunteers Smuxi wouldn't exist. If you have some spare time and
want to give something back then you can contribute to Smuxi in many different
ways. You don't have to a programmer and neither need to become one to
contribute!

## Provide Feedback ##

If you run into an issue or miss something that feels important to you and
possibly others then you can help by reporting issues or requesting features
using [Smuxi's issue tracker][redmine]. All you need to do is to create an
account [here][new account] once. Your account is not usable right away because
the account needs to be approved first. You don't need to specify a your real
name if you don't like, but don't use names that look like you are a spammer ;).
After your account was approved (usually within a day, if not poking meebey on
IRC can help) you are good to create your first bug report or feature request
from [here][new issue]. If you are not sure if you do the right thing in the
tracker, don't hesitate to submit it anyhow. We are thankful for every feedback
you provide and tune the ticket when needed.

## Talk About It ##

You like Smuxi and know people who suffer from bad messaging apps? Do them a
favor and tell them about how Smuxi works for you. They possibly would have a
better messaging experience by using Smuxi. Smuxi is not the right app for
everyone needs of course, but one can only judge this by trying or considering
it at least! So if someone rants about his volatile IRC client, the horrible
Twitter web app or the infamous Facebook web chat, point them to
[[https://smuxi.im]]

## Run Upcoming Versions ##

One important step before a new Smuxi version is released, is to test the new
version before the final release with the release announcement. Why? Assume
newly written code would be released without good testing. This could lead to
nightmares of every software like broken features or even application crashes!
The only way to prevent this is by continuously testing development versions or
at least by testing release candidate before the final release.

If you run into an issue in the new version it is important to report the issue
using Smuxi's bug tracker mentioned in the
*[Provide Feedback](#providefeedback)* section above.

<br/>

*So where do I get release candidates?* Release candidates are usually announced
on the #smuxi-devel @ freenode IRC channel, [Smuxi planet feed][planet-feed]
([RSS version][planet-feed-rss]) and inside the Smuxi itself in the Smuxi
home chat showing Smuxi news. You can also seek for release candidates in this
[web directory][rcs]. All release candidates have a *~rc* suffix in their
filename.

 [planet-feed]: /tags/planet-feed/
 [planet-feed-rss]: /tags/planet-feed/index.rss
 [rcs]: /jaws/data/files/?C=M;O=D

<br/>

*OK, release candidates are good, but where do I get the still bleeding stuff?*
Daily development builds/snapshots of Smuxi are currently only provided as
source code via Git, binary packages for Debian and Ubuntu or only by request
for Mac OS X and Windows. More details can be found in the
[running from git documentation][running-from-git].

## Translate ##

Smuxi is using the [Transifex][] translation project to coordinate and maintain
the translations. If you want to submit or update translations, just visit the
Smuxi project on Transifex [here][Transifex-Smuxi]. If the language is not
present yet simply request a language team and we will approve it. After your
team was approved you can start translating Smuxi to a new language.

 [Transifex-Smuxi]: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/smuxi/

<br/>

*How does Transifex work?* Take a look at this
[Transifex guide on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fG44h4iwuY).
