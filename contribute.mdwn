# Contribute #

Since Smuxi is open-source and free software it is developed by [volunteers][].
Without these volunteers Smuxi wouldn't exist. If you have some spare time and
want to give something back then you can contribute to Smuxi in many different
ways. You don't have to a programmer and neither need to become one to
contribute!

## Provide Feedback ##

If you run into an issue or miss something that feels important to you and
possibly others then you can help by reporting issues or requesting features
using [Smuxi's issue tracker][redmine]. All you need to do is to create an
account [here][new account] once. Your account is not usable right away because
the account needs to be approved first. You don't need to specify a your real
name if you don't like, but don't use names that look like you are a spammer ;).
After your account was approved (usually within a day, if not poking meebey on
IRC can help) you are good to create your first bug report or feature request
from [here][new issue]. If you are not sure if you do the right thing in the
tracker, don't histate to submit it anthow. We are thankful for every feedback
you provide and tune the ticket when needed.

## Talk About It ##

You like Smuxi and know people who suffer from bad messaging apps? Do them a
favor and tell them about how Smuxi works for you. They possibly would have a
better messaging experience by using Smuxi. Smuxi is not the right app for
everyone needs of course, but one can only judge this by trying or considering
it at least! So if someone rants about his volatile IRC client, the horrible
Twitter web app or the infamous Facebook web chat, point them to
[[https://smuxi.im]]
