[[!meta title="""Smuxi 0.8 Release"""]]
[[!meta date="2010-09-04 18:04:48"]]

5 weeks after the 0.7.2.2 "Lovegood" release, I am very happy to announce the
major feature release, **0.8** codenamed **"Godsend"**. Major feature highlights
of this release are desktop notifications (with full support of actions, icons,
updates, append and sound), messaging menu / indicators (as provided by Ubuntu's
[Ayatana project][]) and working Twitter support with OAuth (basic auth was
disabled by Twitter on 31th August). This version also fixes all bugs that were
reported since the release of 0.7.2.2.

 Further on, Smuxi comes with the following improvements in its user interface:

-   More distinct nick colors by using a combination of colors
-   Use of nick colors for userlists
-   Emphasis of own nick in bold, making it easier to distinguish sent messages
-   Toggle-able menubar
-   Full screen mode support for enhanced netbook experience
-   Browse mode support
-   Remembering of tab order when reconnecting to a smuxi-server
-   Sound support by notification daemons which support this extension
-   Display of IRC network name instead of hostname in the tab
-   Addition of "Open Log" button for easy viewing of logs.

Smuxi provides better connectivity and security by supporting: HTTP and SOCKS
proxies as well as secure connections to IRC servers by using SSL with optional
certificate validation.

Last but not least, it comes with an enhanced Twitter experience by supporting
the use of multiple Twitter accounts at the same time,  reformatting tweets that
contain newlines and showing the full retweet instead of a truncated version.

Updated languages includes: French (ClÃ©ment BOURGEOIS) and German (Bianca Mix)

The \#smuxi IRC channel can now also be found, in addition to OFTC, on other
popular IRC networks such as freenode and GIMPnet. The messages on \#smuxi are
automatically relayed between the 3 IRC networks.

If you like Smuxi and want to support it by making micro-donations, [Smuxi is
available on Flattr][].

There are also many other nice FOSS projects available on Flattr, see the
[Flattr-FOSS project][].

Smuxi is available for download from [here][].

**Update:** The Windows installer version **0.8-3** addresses some reported
issues: a dos prompt window is no longer visible, the installed .NET framework
version is now properly detected, .NET 3.5 SP1 is now installed instead of .NET
3.5 as the Twitter support needs this and the Twitter support actually works
now. Just head to the [download page][here] to get these fixes!
