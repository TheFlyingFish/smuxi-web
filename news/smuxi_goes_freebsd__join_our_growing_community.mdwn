[[!meta title="""Smuxi goes FreeBSD - join our growing community"""]]

We have good news for [FreeBSD][] users. Thanks to the work of [Romain
Tartière][] Smuxi is now available in the official FreeBSD ports tree.
Installation instructions can be found on the [download page][].

This is an important step for the cross-platform spirit of Smuxi -- now covering
3 different operating systems: GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and Windows. And don't worry,
this won't be the last one! Mac OSX is high on our priority list but we don't
have the resources yet to make this happen. We are looking forward to see
Smuxi's community growing so it can reach even more users regardless of their
operating system, language or origin.

Everyone is invited to join the community! If you are interested and have some
spare time, Smuxi is looking for help in many areas:

-   artwork: layout, logo, icons
-   translations
-   documentation: how-to, built-in help, tooltips
-   installer / packages: Mac OSX, RPM (Fedora / Red Hat)
-   programming: features, bugfixes, ports, further protocols (Jabber, MSN, etc)
-   distribution: articles (wikipedia), reviews, news, download sites, etc

The easiest way to get in touch with us is to join the \#smuxi IRC channel on
OFTC (irc.oftc.net)
