[29 bugfixes][] and [13 features][] later I am happy to announce the second
bugfix release, **0.7.2** codenamed **'Lovegood'**. This version fixes all bugs
that were reported since the release of 0.7.1 but also introduces some very sexy
new features!

As the codename suggests, this release contains both love and goods. There are
new features that everybody loves such as: [file logging][], [configurable
highlight words][] (Chris Le Sueur), [fully customizable filters to ignore
messages or events][], [markerlines which divide old messages from new
messages][], [enhanced network status and window title format][], and
[extended][] [CTCP support][]. Too good to be true? It's real!  The feedback I
received from [FOSDEM 2010][] has spurred development and attracted [new
developers][] and translators.

Smuxi news can also be retrieved by following the [official Smuxi Twitter
account][].

New languages includes: Portuguese (Americo Monteiro), Danish (Joe Hansen),
partially Finnish (Kalle Kaitala), and partially Catalan (Siegfried-Angel
Gevatter Pujals). Updated languages includes: French (ClÃ©ment BOURGEOIS),
German (Bianca Mix), Italian (Vincenzo Campanella), Czech (Michal Simunek),
Swedish (Martin Bagge), and British (Ryan Smith-Evans).

Going forward, translations will be coordinated and maintained by using
[Transifex][]. If you wish to submit or update translations, simply visit the
[Smuxi project on Transifex][]. You can find out how Transifex works by reading
our [Translation HowTo][].

All bugfixes and features can be found on the [completed 0.7.2 roadmap][].

**Update:** [**0.7.2** **crashes on start**][] for new installations and
existing installations that don't have remote engines defined. ~~I will push a
0.7.2.1 emergency release ASAP!~~ Smuxi **0.7.2.1 fixes the crash** and is
available for download.

**Update:** **0.7.2.1** contained a few annoying bugs such as: [crash when
saving configuration changes with remote engines][], [bug in the new markerline
feature][], [message pattern field of filters never matched][] and [missing
IRCnet server in default settings][], which were all fixed in the **0.7.2.2**
bugfix-only release, available for download.
