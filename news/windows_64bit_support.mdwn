I have good news to our Windows users. The new installer (0.6.4-4-dev) of Smuxi
now supports Windows 64-bit. This was tested on Windows Vista and Windows 7 RC1.
Smuxi is not running in 64-bit execution mode (yet) but in 32-bit mode because
GTK+ is not yet fully ported for Windows 64-bit. Windows XP 64-bit should also
work, if not please write me an [email][] or join our [IRC channel][]. You can
get Smuxi 0.6.4-4-dev from the [download page][].
