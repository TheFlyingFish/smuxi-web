Yep, you read correctly the title, finally smuxi 0.6.0 is released!

After 3 years of development here it is, the flexible and cross-platform IRC
client (actually it's multi-protocol, but the 0.6 only includes IRC support).

So here a feature list of what the 0.6 release includes:

-   multi-server support
-   multi-protocol support (currently only IRCÂ  included)
-   detachable frontend (limitation: requires TCP ports in both directions -\>
    not NAT safe (yet))
-   basic theming
-   server manager
-   find group chat (channels)
-   quick connect to servers
-   configurable interface
-   on startup commands
-   on connect commands (global and per server)
-   nickname completion (normal and bash-style)

So here it is, in all proud and glory:
