Yes, I am doing already big steps splitting Gnosmirc into 2 parts, engine and
frontend. The engine contains all Gnosmirc application logic and features, and
the frontend displays the current messages/states of that engine. The base for
this will be .NET Remoting, I am already testing alot how I can use it for
Gnosmirc. Some tests were already a big success.

Within this testphase I am writing UML diagrams for Gnosmirc, I really don't
wanna do another another rewrite because I forgot to look at the big picture, I
bet every developer understands this who outgrow on their projects.

Since this core rewrite is going on, I am planing on writing myself now all
layouts instead of using Glade. Glade is great but it does not give me the
flexibility I need for making a flexible IRC GUI client, it limits me in object
design which is a PITA. The Windows port of Gnosmirc was almost working, but
glade stopped this. Reason is I used a newer glade version for development on my
linux workstation than the windows version of glade (shipped with Gtk# for
windows). So it failed on that, hardly, mostly all places produced crashes.
Means after kicking glade, Gnosmirc will run on Windows too! Don't get me wrong
though, Glade is a cool GUI tool, but it's not a solution for everything,
allright stay tuned ;)
