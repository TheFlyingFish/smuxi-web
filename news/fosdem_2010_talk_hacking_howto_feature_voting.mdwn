#### FOSDEM 2010 Talk

Early this year I was giving an [introduction talk of Smuxi at FOSDEM 2010][] in
Brussels.Â  In case you haven't watched it yet, you can watch it on YouTube
[here][].

#### Hacking HowTo

On the \#smuxi IRC channel new people are asking how to get started with Smuxi
development. If you are interested in enhancing Smuxi by programming, then this
new [Smuxi Hacking HowTo][] is a must read for you.

#### Feature Voting

Even if you are not a programmer and also not planning to become one you can
still get your favorite features faster by voting for them! Just head to
[Smuxi's ticket system][], login or signup an account, open the feature ticket
you would like to have and hit the green vote button. When I am deciding which
feature to implement next, I will check which feature has the most votes and
pick that one over others! So keep voting for your favorite features, or file a
new feature request if it doesn't exist yet.
