As promised here are the Debian and Ubuntu packages for the 0.6.1 release of
smuxi!

For Linux package maintainers out there, I welcome very much smuxi packages for
other Linux distributions like OpenSUSE, Gentoo, ArchLinux, ForeSight and so on!
Visit me on IRC \#smuxi @ OFTC or [write me an email][].
