After a successful hacking weekend I am happy to announce that Smuxi has a cool
new feature. With the next Smuxi release you will be able to receive and send
tweets from/to [Twitter][]. For those who don't know yet what Twitter is, it's a
micro-blogging tool which I am using heavily for the past few weeks/months.
Smuxi supports the friends timeline, replies view and direct messages. Check out
[this screenshot][] which shows this feature in action. I am planning to add
avatar and reply-mode support at some point later.
