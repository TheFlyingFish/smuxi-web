Ok, after a few days (4 continues days, to be more accurate) I have a first
working smuxi frontend!

Like I said in an earlier post it's the Gtk/Gnome frontend. I can spawn the
engine (smuxi-engine.dll) with the frontend, or standalone (smuxi-server.exe).
Then I can spawn one or many frontends (like smuxi-gtkgnome.exe) and connect to
the engine and then go IRC chatting. I can quit the frontend, the engine stays
alive and continues doing all IRC work, then I can start later again a frontend
and I got the same state as it was!

Now I am focusing to get the frontend user friendly, it lakes some GUI windows
yet, like the IRC server manager, engine manager and preferences. Those GUIs are
passed by writing directly the INI file :-P that is more for testing though, but
it is possible to not use the GUI to configure or use smuxi at all ;-)

This alpha version is limited to known alpha testers, no public release. When
the missing GUIs are added and I made some optimizations then smuxi is ready for
a beta release, which will be public and with source! If you want to be alpha
tester, please join #smuxi on irc.freenode.org and idle there, thanks!

Oh I almost forgot :-P. I uploaded 2 screenshots of smuxi with the detachble
frontend feature in action, just check the screenshot section out!
