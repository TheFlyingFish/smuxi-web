Since I am working heavily on the new codebase which will give us the detachable
frontend feature, I found the name Gnosmirc does not fit anymore for a few
reasons. When I started Gnosmirc I focused the Gnome GUI toolkit, with this new
feature, Gnome will be just one frontend of many. Also users could see an
association with the name of "mIRC" which I do not like at all. So a new project
name was born: smuxi - Smart MUltipleXed Irc. Smuxi reflects exactly the main
feature of it which is pretty unique to almost all IRC clients. So lets smuxing!
