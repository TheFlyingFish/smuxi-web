The #smuxi IRC channel moved from freenode to OFTC, I was annoyed again today
when I was sending an private message to a smuxi alpha tester and he didn't get
my message. Enough is enough. The pm "spam-filtering" is just idiotic, I got
more spam from lilo than spam via private messages. Also the CTCP or color
filtering, specially when testing smuxi is not that useful, so we moved. Now you
can reach us on #smuxi on irc.oftc.net, see you there.
