OMG, after hacking hours on the engine, I finally got the engine running the
first time with 2 text frontends using 2 different users! I have to fine tune
some stuff yet but the base of the engine works like it should.

So now I can actually start implementate the Gtk/GNOME frontend for Smuxi. Some
things in the engine are not yet strictly defined, I will have to make some more
think-about-the-big-picture-sessions while I am hacking the frontend. Currently
the text frontend is just a test yet to see what the engine tries for debugging.

Stay tuned ;-)
