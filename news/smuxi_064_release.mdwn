I am happy to announce the 0.6.4 release of Smuxi. This release contains
important changes for supporting Windows and Mac OS X as it no longer requires
the GNOME\# library. The SSH-support for the communication between the server
and the frontend is now official and has been integrated into the GUI. This
means Smuxi can safely be used now with NAT and port-based firewalls. For a
detailed list of changes, please read the feature and bugfix list below.

**New features:**

-   Feature \#1: support (clickable) URLs in topic
-   Feature \#15: add date stamps between days like irssi
-   Feature \#28: support mIRC colors in topic
-   Feature \#63: replace GNOME\# API calls with GTK\# API
-   Feature \#64: Remove dependency on TCP ports for 2-way communication
    (passive mode)
