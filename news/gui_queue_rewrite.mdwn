[[!meta title="""GUI queue rewrite"""]]

Yes, I am working on it already. The problematic GUI queue based on
Gtk.ThreadNotify is being replaced by GLib.IdleHandler. The concept is much
different, when Gtk has nothing to do (no draws, no updates etc) then the
IdleHandler  will be called. In that IdleHandler method  it will work on the
queue (GUI changes that are pending, like showing new IRC messages to the
channel pages) and does the actual work. This means when gtk is "done" or
"ready" for making new changes to  the GUI, then Gnosmirc will process his
changes. In practice this should give a much more interactive GUI programm (when
its under load). The GUI hangs should not happen anymore this way, since if gtk
has alot to do (making new pages, updates userslists etc) then no further GUI
changes are done (from the queue) till gtk has finished first the current
pending work. Also what I like about this approach is, I wrap the IRC callbacks
into the gtk main thread, so I don't have to create containers for each GUI
change (that was a real PITA)! The rewrite is not completed yet, the svn repo is
inconsistent now, so be careful if you svn update ;-)
Allright thats it for now...
