So one week after 0.6.0, here we go, the first minor bugfix/feature release of
the 0.6 series!

I received a lot of feedback from smuxi users, thanks goes to all smuxi users
for that. This helps me making smuxi a great IRC client. So what does this
bugfix release include? Well, it contains some bugfixes but there was no major
bugs like crashes or anything, seems like someone tested smuxi very well :-P

As it didn't contain much bugs, I also added some smaller features, here the
list:

New features:

-   Group chats behind their protocol chat. ([trac \#54][])
-   Added Whois to popup menu in channels. ([trac \#57][])
-   Added Kick+Ban to popup menu in channels. ([trac \#58][])
-   Reduced logging from debug to info level, to get debug level -d can be
    passed as argument to smuxi-server and smuxi-frontend-gnome. ([trac \#59][]
    [trac \#60][])
-   Tabs can be re-ordered now, but only with GTK\# 2.10, the order will not be
    retained though after restart. ([trac \#68][])
-   Multiple users can be selected in channels now to do actions. ([trac
    \#73][])

Bug fixes:

-   Changing topic and user list position will now be applied without
    restarting. ([trac \#56][])
-   Fixed "make check" ([trac \#53][])
-   Fixed "/window close" command and ctrl+w hotkey ([trac \#67][])

So what are you waiting for? Get smuxi 0.6.1 from the [download page][]!

Please keep giving me feedback by submitting TRAC tickets, joining on IRC or
writing emails! That's what make me going ;)

**Attention to Windows users:** with the 0.6.1 release I made a win32 package
that will run if you follow the "Windows Install" instructions from the download
page!

Tomorrow I will try to get Debian and Ubuntu packages done for Smuxi. For some
odd reason I couldn't get 0.6.0 packages building because autofoo failed on
Debian/Etch not finding install-sh while it was there...

**Update:**the source tarball of smuxi 0.6.1 and smartirc4net have been updated!
Smuxi builds from source cleanly now, check the [download page][].
