If you wondered what's happening, the beta release is very close. I plan to
release smuxi beta (0.6) this month. Smuxi made good steps forward regarding
stability and API design. I've been using smuxi as my primary IRC client almost
a year already and it's fun.

Also the GNOME frontend is not the only one anymore :) I made proof-of-concept
frontends using different UI toolkits like [Curses][] / [STFL][] and [WinForms
(native Windows)][]. The WinForms frontend was started and is maintained by
Zhila. The proof-of-concept frontends will be a very good base for other
developers wanting to contribute to the smuxi project. The different frontends
was needed to find possible API design flaws, and I found some but those were
minor issues.

That's not all yet I need to blog! The IRC protocol implementation was always
made in modular fashion. It is only an implementation of a protocol manager
interface. But I never managed to implement a different protocol (no time, no
real interest) but some months ago I got hot trying the XMPP / Jabber protocol,
as many of my friends are using different protocols (like ICQ, AIM, MSN). Jabber
supports gateways to other protocols, so I thought with Jabber I could kill all
protocol holes with one stone. And that was a big success, smuxi has now
experimental Jabber support too, supporting person and group chats (no presence
/ contacts though). Too much text already? Then check this [screenshot][]. On
that screenshot you can see me connected to a Jabber server, chatting to
iamthejaymann through the Jabber server over the AIM gateway :) I think that's
enough news for now, it's getting hot in here ;)

Stay tuned, it's worth it!
