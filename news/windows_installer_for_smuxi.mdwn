Smuxi has now a full featured installer for Windows! Sebastian Schnur
\<ikkerus@ikkerus.net\> was so nice and contributed a NSIS installer script for
Smuxi. The old "installer" (just a simple zip file) has been replaced on the
download page with this one already. I couldn't resist and enhanced the
installer script to automatically download and install the software requirements
when needed, which is MSI 3.1, Microsoft .NET 2.0 and GTK\# 2.12. The installer
works perfectly (tested) under Windows XP and Windows 7. At this time only 32bit
is supported as GTK+/\# isn't ready yet for 64bit on Windows. I read that you
can run GTK\# apps in 32bit mode on 64bit Windows, but the application and
library files have to be masked somehow, but I could not find out yet how to do
that using Linux.

Are you runningÂ  Windows and want to give it a try? Just grab it from the
[download page][]! (if you wonder why the version is 0.6.4-dev for the Windows
build, I made a development release which includes the
[feature/\#63\_drop\_gnome-sharp][] branch)
