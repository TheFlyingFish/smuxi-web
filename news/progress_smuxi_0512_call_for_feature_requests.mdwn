Some of you may believe nothing is happening with smuxi, but this is not true. I
am working on implementing missing features and fixing bugs found by smuxi alpha
testers. Smuxi supports now colors and formattings on MOTD, channels and
queries. Colors and formattings can also be stripped with a setting for the
ASCII-printable fans :-P
I also plan to add support for stripping UTF-8 chars and replace them with "?"
(like irssi does for example).
The current alpha version (0.5.12) also runs on Windows just as it does on
Linux, using Microsoft .NET + Gtk# 2.7.1 for MS .NET.

If you want some special feature that is missing in other IRC clients, please
write a quick comment to this post.
