I uploaded a new version (0.6.4.1-2) of the Windows installer, as the SSH
support was broken spitting out the following error message each time you try to
connect:

    plink: unknown option "-auto_store_key_in_cache"

This issue was caused by the wrong included plink version (an application part
of the putty tools) used for the SSH tunnel. Also the installer no longer
requires a reboot after the automatic GTK\# install, which should make new users
happy. :-)

Linux users don't have to update anything, no issues or changes there.
