It was time for a Gnosmirc homepage. This one is based on the cool [Jaws
project][], take a look it at. So on this page we will show some exciting
screenshots of Gnosmirc and keep you uptodate with the project status. Currently
I am working on the 0.3 version which is a big GUI rewrite. Most dynamic GUI
parts was done directly in C\#, now I am using Glade\# for templates like
channel, query and serverpage. After this rewrite is finished I will do another
rewrite for the 0.4 release, this time it will be the OO design of Gnosmirc.
Since its my first GUI project I ever made I am learning alot of how things go
and not go :) So keep an eye on this site, I am not sure yet if 0.3 or 0.4 will
be an official release. I only want to release useable programs, I don't like
half-finished just put it out releases, it's not fair to the users.... I will
post it here when the time is ready!
