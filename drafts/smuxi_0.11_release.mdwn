[[!meta title="""Smuxi 0.11 with multi identity support, message patterns, fixed Twitter and new website"""]]

And here we go again! We're proud to announce the new version of Smuxi, release
0.11 "***Distractions***". During the development, [11 bug reports][bugs] and
[2 feature requests][features] in [112 commits][commits] were worked on. Notable
highlights in this release are:

### User Interface Enhancements ###

* The chat list can be shrunken, this is especially handy with XMPP/Jabber and
  long group chat identifiers.
* The highlight counter is now a separate column which enhances the vertical
  alignment with other highlights and guarantees to be visible even if the chat
  name was truncated.

### Multi Identity Support ###

Smuxi cares for its user feedback. Multi identity support was the
most voted feature and thus it got implemented! Now you can please your
schizo^Wdesire to use different nick, user and real names depending on the
server. Simply edit the server in preferences and change the details.

### Message Patterns ###

Everybody knows text can be boring because it is all just text. Nothing can
sidetrack you except reading that bare text. Text often have recurring patterns
that could be used as information to create something useful from it and make
the text more interactive. For example someone writes:

    Hey meebey, do you know RFC2812?

RFCs are a recurring pattern with a distinct number behind it and are real
references to something in the internet (collection of protocol specifications).

So usually I would now fire up a browser tab, copy/paste or typing RFC2812 into
my favorite search engine and click the first hit and then reply to that
question. But with Smuxi's message patterns it turns RFC2812 into a link for
you which you can simple click and it point you to the right document on the
right website.

Wow this is very cool, but isn't this already happening with http URLs and email
addresses? Exactly! Why shouldn't more information be used to create useful
things from it? Smuxi message patterns allow you to define text patterns that
are transformed into clickable links. This can be used for RFCs, CVEs, bug
report numbers (#XXX), git commit hashes and much more, make good use of your
creativity.

By default Smuxi comes with built-in message patterns for:

  * URLs
  * heuristic URLs (not starting with http:// etc)
  * email addresses
  * RFCs
  * CVEs
  * Debian Security Advisories (DSA)
  * Many popular bug trackers (GNU, GCC, kernel, Launchpad, freedesktop,
    GNOME, KDE, Xfce, Debian, Redhat, Novell, Xamarin, openSUSE, Mozilla, Samba,
    SourceForge, CPAN, boost, Claws and Smuxi)

If you know more general patterns useful for others, please [report][]!

### Hooks Enhancements ###

 * A bug was fixed that prevented hooks from issuing more than one command
 * New hook points:
   * engine/session/on-group-chat-person-added
   * engine/session/on-group-chat-person-removed
   * engine/session/on-group-chat-person-updated

### Twitter Enhancements ###

As of 14 Jan 2014 Twitter disallows unencrypted HTTP requests which broke
Smuxi's Twitter support. Smuxi is now making exclusively encrypted requests
(HTTPS) and thus works with Twitter again.

### JabbR (Beta) Enhancements ###

 * Messages now raise [Smuxi hooks][hooks]
 * The Validate certificate setting is now correctly honored.

### Updated Translations ###

Smuxi should now be in your language, including:

 * Initial complete Dutch (Jeroen Baten)

### Behind the Scenes ###

 * New [Smuxi git repository @ GNOME](https://git.gnome.org/browse/smuxi)
 * Cleaner XMPP code (Oliver Schneider)
 * Smuxi's STFL text frontend is doing a graceful shutdown on quit (Calvin B) 
 * New sexy website! We hope you like it :)
