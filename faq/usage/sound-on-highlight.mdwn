question="How do I get a sound when someone highlights me?"
answer="""
Smuxi does not make use of any sound system/library as they are highly operating
system dependent (Windows and OS X use something differen than Linux and Linux
alone has _3_ different ones). Instead Smuxi relies on GTK/GNOME to play a sound
when a message with a highlight was received. You can enable this in the GNOME
sound settings.

For GNOME2 you can find this in **System -> Preferences -> Sound** then switch
to the **Sound Theme tab**, select a sound theme and alert sound from the list.

For GNOME3 you can find this in **Your-Name Menu (top right corner) -> Settings
-> Sound** then switch to Sound Effects tab, set the alert volume to high and
select the alert sound from the list.

For any other desktop environment (like KDE) you will need to make this setting
using this console command: 

    dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/sound/event-sounds true
