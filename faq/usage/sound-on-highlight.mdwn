question="How do I get a sound when someone highlights me?"
answer="""
Smuxi does not make use of any sound system/library as they are highly operating
system dependent (Windows and OS X use something different than Linux and Linux
alone has _3_ different ones). Instead Smuxi relies on GTK+/GNOME to play a sound
when a message with a highlight was received. You can enable this in the GNOME
sound settings.

<br/>

For _GNOME2_ you can find this in **System -> Preferences -> Sound** then switch
to the **Sound Theme** tab, select a sound theme and alert sound from the list.

<br/>

For _GNOME3_ you can find this in **Your-Name Menu (top right corner) ->
Settings -> Sound** then switch to **Sound Effects** tab, set the alert volume
to high and select the alert sound from the list.

<br/>

For any _other desktop environment_ (like _KDE_) you will need to make this
setting using this console command: 

    dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/sound/event-sounds true
