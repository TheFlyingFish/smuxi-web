question="Why am I having certificate issues in Linux?"
answer="""
You may have issues relating to authentication certificates in Mono resulting in an error that looks like this:
<br/>
`Connection failed! Reason: Could not connect to: irc.freenode.net:7070 The authentication or decryption has failed.`
<br/>
Here are some steps you can take to hopefully fix this:
<br/>
*  Make sure you have the mono developer tools:  `sudo apt-get install mono-devel`
<br/>
*  Next, import Mozilla's root CA certificates via:  `mozroots --import --ask-remove` -- do this as the user who is running smuxi-server, not as root.
<br/>
*  Grab the "intermediate certificate" for the IRC network you're using.  Example:  As the user who is running the smuxi-server (not root), run `certmgr -ssl https://irc.freenode.net:7070`.   Even though you may see a `*** WARNING: Certificate signature is INVALID ***`, this is apparently okay.  Say "y" to import this certificate into the CA store.
<br/>
*  Now, to work around a bug in mono, add these two directories:  `sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/.mono/keypairs` and `sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/.mono/certs` .
<br/>
*  Last trick-- you'll need to set an environment variable to keep TLS (the secure connection) from caching.  That means prepending `MONO_TLS_SESSION_CACHE_TIMEOUT=0` to the command you use to start smuxi.  For example:  `MONO_TLS_SESSION_CACHE_TIMEOUT=0 nohup smuxi-server &`
<br/>
Hopefully this will fix the issue.
